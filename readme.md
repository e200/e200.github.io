# e200.github.io

Hi!!! This is my portfolio, and soon I'll write the case of stude of it on this document.

But for now, i'm dropping the usage of my own js library [anotherJS](https://github.com/e200/anotherJS) by jQuery since some libraries that I really love depends on it and its really hard to maintain a page on this way.

I'm also thinking about drop support for IE <= 10 and start using flexbox instead of display: (table||table-cell).
