# e200.github.io portfolio (v2.1)

Welcome! I hope you enjoy my code. :slightly_smiling_face:

This isn't a Vue.js template based project.

Everything was setup from scratch including the project structure and the Webpack config.

My initial idea was to build a simple static landing page, but I decide later to include the aweasome **Vue.js** and empower the project.
